Thesis: _The Effects of Inflammation, Interoceptive Focus, and Social Target on Self-Other Overlap_

Date: April 8, 2025

This is the R code I wrote for my senior honors thesis, which analyzed transcriptions of conversations. In _Compile Demos and Surveys,_ I compiled our variables (demographics, condition, interoceptive values, social target) from multiple collected datasets, with interoceptive values dervied from the external Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms database. We extracted pronoun use measures from the text to measure self-other overlap. In _Analyses and Graphs_, we ran repeated-measures ANOVA models and created graphs to visualize the relationships using _ggplot_.
